# Layout & Style

## Grid System

Vuesora uses a 12 point grid system. Built using the flex-box css spec, the grid is used to layout an applicationâ€™s 
content. It contains 5 types of media breakpoints that are used for targeting specific screen sizes or orientations. 
The modifier classes represent a fraction of the pages width over 12.

### Breakpoints

| Breakpoint      | Acronym | Type                      | Range
|-----------------|---------|---------------------------|-------
| Extra Small     | xs      | small to large handset    | < 640px
| Small           | sm      | small to medium tablet    | 641px - 1025px
| Medium          | md      | large tablet to laptop    | 1026px - 1240px
| Large           | lg      | desktop                   | 1241px - 1940px
| Extra Large     | xl      | Hi-Res and Ultrawide      | > 1940px

### Usage

All content MUST be placed in a parent `.container` this creates the basic responsive page container, flex content 
can then be placed inside, and behave as expected. `.container` can be given the `.fluid` class and it will always take 
up 100% of the viewports width.

```html
<div class="container">
    ...
</div>

<!-- OR -->

<div class="container fluid">
    ...
</div>
```

Flex containers can then be created using the `.flex` class, this will create a container with the display: flex; 
property with the grow and shrink properties set to 1, and the flex basis at auto (including all children). 
To control the flex direction either use the `.flex-row` or `.flex-column` classes.

- `.flex-row` will make it's child content flow along the X-Axis
- `.flex-column` will make it's child content flow along the Y-Axis
- This means that the child containers will take up the amount of space specified in the flex-basis property 
(on the axis of the parents' flex-direction), which is by default - auto

```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="flex flex-row">
        <div class="flex flex-column">
            ...
        </div>
        <div class="flex flex-column">
            ...
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

In order to specify the `flex-basis` property we use the grid modifier classes, prepended by the breakpoint acronym, 
and appended by the numerator (between 1 and 12), it looks something like this `.{ acronym }-{ numerator }`. 
For example: the modifier class `.sm-10` specifies that the container will take up 10 out of 12 units or 83.33%, 
starting at the small breakpoint. Keep in mind that flex containers with a modifier class will have the `flex-grow` and 
`flex-shrink` properties set to 0. (This way they will always be the width/height specified in the modifier.)

```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="flex flex-row">
        <div class="flex flex-column xs-12 sm-4 md-3">
            ...
        </div>
        <div class="flex flex-column xs-12 sm-8 md-9">
            ...
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Visibility

Responsive visibility is also achieved using the same convention as the grid, simply prepend the 
breakpoint acronym with the hide property and append it with the condition `.hide-{ acronym }-{ condition }`. 
For example `.hide-sm-only` will hide the element ONLY on the small breakpoint, `.hide-sm-up` will hide the element 
from the small breakpoint and up, only visible on the extra small breakpoint. The same works the other way with 
`.hide-sm-down`.

```html
<div class="hide-xs-only">
    ...
</div>
```

## Spacing

Vuesora uses a dynamic spacing system built off of a variable titled `$gutterWidth` which is defined at **1.875rem 
(roughly 32px)**. To add spacing to an element either use the margin or padding modifiers using the following convention 
`.{ type }{ part }-{ amount }`.

The `{ type }` applies the type of spacing:

- `p` - applies padding
- `m` - applies margin

The `{ part }` applies it a specific part of the element:

- `a` - applies spacing to all sides
- `v` - applies spacing to the top and bottom
- `h` - applies spacing to the left and right
- `t` - applies spacing to the top
- `b` - applies spacing to the bottom
- `l` - applies spacing to the left
- `r` - applies spacing to the right

The `{ amount }` applies the amount of spacing:

- `1` - `$gutterWidth` divided by 3
- `2` - `$gutterWidth` divided by 2
- `3` - `$gutterWidth`
- `4` - `$gutterWidth` multiplied by 1.5
- `5` - `$gutterWidth` multiplied by 1.666

```html
<div class="pa-3 mb-3">
    ...
</div>
```

_Alternatively, you can choose to omit the `{ amount }` to give it a responsive spacing amount. 
(Equivalent to 2 on desktop and tablet sizes and 1 on mobile sizes) Ex: `.pa`_
